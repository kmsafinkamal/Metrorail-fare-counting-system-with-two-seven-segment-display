Our project is of Metrorail fare counting. Where, we are estimating the fare of passengers by 
the length of their travelling in the Metrorail in kilometers. We are counting it in a simple 
manner just to show the implementation. We fixed 1 Km for 5Tk. We are doing it for 1 to 15 
kilometers. Because we have the input of 4bits(A,B,C,D). We have shown this using the seven 
segment display so that we can get a decimal result to understand the output quickly.
